#LightCurves
The goal here is to read stars from one MongoDB catalog and create a list of light curves saved in another MongoDB catalog.

The magic of populating the first database with planets around the stars happened in a Node.js project. This project only generates a simple light curve of those planes.

The ultimate goal at the time was to write code that would detect the changes in the light curves and thus detect the planets. All this was to be a test run against the actual light curves from satellite observations.

Work and other commitments came along derailed this project.

All the databases used were on my local network and no longer exist. The main database Linux machine has been repurposed.
